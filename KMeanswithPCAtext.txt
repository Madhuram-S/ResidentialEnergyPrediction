After exporting the PCA components, we reimport the new CSV to use for KMeans Clustering. KMeans can be used to determine clusters of data and make decisions based off the clusters which values you can exclude to increase accuracy. 

Using the variable REGIONC and TOTALBTU, the KMeans elbow curve shows the clusters needed to group the data is between 8 and 10, when the curve flattens at 0 score value.

Creating a scatter plot of 10 clusters with the PCA transformed x and y plots (REGIONC and TOTALBTU), the graph shows alot of the data in general correlates to predicting the values of x and y, with another cluster that does not correlate and can be reduced from the data set.
